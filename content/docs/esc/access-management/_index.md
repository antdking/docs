Pulumi ESC provides identity and access management (IAM) controls to secure your environments, secrets, and configurations. Using role-based access control (RBAC), teams can enforce least-privilege access across environments, ensuring that users only have the permissions they need. ESC also supports access tokens for programmatic authentication and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for integrating with external identity providers.

## Access controls in Pulumi ESC

- [Teams and Role-based access control(RBAC)](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/teams/): Manage permissions at the organization and environment levels.
- [Access tokens](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/access-tokens/): Securely authenticate and automate ESC operations.
- [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/docs/esc/access-management/oidc/): Enable single sign-on (SSO) and federated authentication.

For a deeper dive into environment-specific access control, see the [Pulumi ESC access control](/docs/esc/access-management/access-control/) documentation.
